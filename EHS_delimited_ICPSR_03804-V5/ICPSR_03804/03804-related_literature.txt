The Early Head Start Research and Evaluation project, a rigorous, large-
scale, random-assignment evaluation of Early Head Start, was designed to
carry out the recommendation of the Advisory Committee on Services for
Families with Infants and Toddlers for a strong research and evaluation
component to support continuous improvement within the Early Head Start
program and to meet the 1994 reauthorization requirement for a national
evaluation of the new infant-toddler program. The Early Head Start Research
and Evaluation project was funded in three waves. The Congressionally-
mandated Birth to Three Phase (1996-2001) included an Implementation Study,
an Impact Evaluation that investigated program impacts on children and
families through their time in the program, and local research projects. In
2001, the Administration for Children and Families (ACF) funded the Pre-
Kindergarten Follow-up Phase (2001-2004) to build upon the earlier research
and follow the children and families who were in the original study from
the time they left the Early Head Start program until they entered
kindergarten. In 2005, ACF funded the Elementary School Follow-up Phase
(2005-2010) to again build upon earlier research and follow the children
and families from the original study while the children are in fifth grade,
or attending their sixth year of formal schooling.

Early Head Start (EHS) is a two-generation program for pregnant women and
families with infants or toddlers. Offered to those with limited incomes,
its goal is to enhance children's development and health and to strengthen
family and community partnerships. The Early Head Start Research and
Evaluation Project (EHSREP), sponsored by the U.S. Department of Health and
Human Services, Administration for Children and Families (ACF), was
designed to answer questions about the overall impact of EHS programs and
services on children and families and reveal how specific types of programs
and services affect children and families that have different
characteristics and life circumstances. Mathematica Policy Research led the
rigorous evaluation, which was launched at about the same time the EHS
program was authorized in 1995. In this data compendium, we provide a
single source for information about the measures used throughout the
EHSREP. We begin with an overview of the EHSREP design and then report the
sample, data collection instruments, and response rates for each of three
EHSREP data collection phases (birth to age 3, prekindergarten, and grade
5). Next, we describe the various data sets and documentation that are
available to data users, and we provide a general description of how we
have organized the more detailed information on the measures we used to
create variables and scores for the public use data files. Appendix A
contains detailed descriptions of the measures, including measure
citations, publisher psychometrics and permissions, the wave or waves in
which each measure was used, and information on the scales or variables in
the EHSREP data set that were derived from these measures. (author

This interim report presents findings from the impact evaluation of the
Early Head Start Research and evaluation project and focuses on child and
family outcomes through the children's first two years of life. The report
explores variations in child, parent, and family outcomes resulting from
participation in Early Head Start programs, as well as from differences in
program approaches and community contexts, program implementation and
services, and the characteristics of children and families themselves. The
sample included 17 EHS sites and 3,001 families, which represented the
diversity of program approaches and family characteristics typical of EHS
across the country. All families were randomly assigned to either the
program or control group prior to receiving any services. Data collected
included standardized assessment, interview, survey and observation data,
as well as program documentation. Data were collected when families
enrolled in the program, as well as at 6 and 15 months after enrollment and
when children were 14 and 24 months old. Regression analyses suggest that
participation in EHS had a significant impact on children cognitive and
language development, parenting, home environment, and family self-
sufficiency, as well as on the type and amount of services received by
families. EHS impact varied among different program approaches and levels
of implementation.

The final report of the Early Head Start (EHS) Research and Evaluation
project documents the services that EHS families received over 26 months,
examines variations in services delivered by programs, and assesses the
impact of the program on 3-year old children and their families. The
evaluation explored how child, parent and family outcomes were influenced
by EHS programs, as well as by variations in program approaches, program
implementation and the characteristics of children and their families. 17
EHS sites, representing diverse approaches and family characteristics
typical of EHS, were selected to participate in the evaluation through
purposive sampling methods. 3,001 families were randomly assigned to
program and control groups. Standardized assessments, observations,
videotapes, program implementation data, and interview and survey data were
collected longitudinally, based on the number of months since random
assignment (6,15, and 26 months) and the age of the focus child (14, 24,
and 36 months of age). EHS programs promoted children's development
(cognitive, language and social emotional), as well as supportive parenting
practices (reading, HOME scores, supportive interactions, parent-child
activities) and father involvement. Programs were also shown to encourage
some aspects of parents' economic self-sufficiency (education and
employment). Data were analyzed according to various program and family
demographic sub-groupings. Impacts were strongest in subgroups of fully
implemented sites, among parents who enrolled during pregnancy, African
American parents, and those at moderate levels of demographic risks. There
were programs that did not have positive impacts on families at the highest
levels of demographic risks, and some impacts were unfavorable.

by EHS programs, as well as by variations in program approaches, program
implementation and the characteristics of children and their families. 17
EHS sites, representing diverse approaches and family characteristics
typical of EHS, were selected to participate in the evaluation through
purposive sampling methods. 3,001 families were randomly assigned to
program and control groups. Standardized assessments, observations,
videotapes, program implementation data, and interview and survey data were
collected longitudinally, based on the number of months since random
assignment (6,15, and 26 months) and the age of the focus child (14, 24,
and 36 months of age). EHS programs promoted children's development
(cognitive, language and social emotional), as well as supportive parenting
practices (reading, HOME scores, supportive interactions, parent-child
activities) and father involvement. Programs were also shown to encourage
some aspects of parents' economic self-sufficiency (education and
employment). Data were analyzed according to various program and family
demographic sub-groupings. Impacts were strongest in subgroups of fully
implemented sites, among parents who enrolled during pregnancy, African
American parents, and those at moderate levels of demographic risks. There
were programs that did not have positive impacts on families at the highest
levels of demographic risks, and some impacts were unfavorable.
